This is a Bukkit plugin to spawn a horse. Bukkit is a 3rd party Minecraft server.

I decided to try my hands at creating custom plugins for Bukkit, It's quite easy actually. This one is based on the SamplePlugin that Bukkit provides on their own GitHub.

This plugin is fo' free and you can do what you want with it. That being said it comes without any warranty, I'm not respnosible for anything that happens as a result of using this software.
